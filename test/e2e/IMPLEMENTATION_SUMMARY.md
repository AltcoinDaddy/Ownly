- Event filtering based on user relevance
- Notification queue management and preferences
- Connection failure and reconnection handling

#### 6. Error Handling & Recovery (`error-handling.spec.ts`)

- API rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Flow transaction failures and recovery options
- IPFS upload failures with fallback strategies
- Session timeout and re-authentication flows
- Browser compatibility issue handling

#### 7. Complete User Journeys (`complete-user-journey.spec.ts`)
- **Creator Journey**: Connect → Mint → List → Sell (full workflow)
- **Transfer Journey**: Complete P2P transfer with real-time updates
- **Error Recovery**: End-to-end error handling throughout workflows

### ✅ Technical Implementation

#### Flow Emulator Integration
```typescript
// Automatic Flow emulator setup in global-setup.ts
- Waits for emulator startup
- Deploys DapperCollectibles and DapperMarket contracts
- Sets up test accounts with initial state
- Mints test NFTs for testing scenarios
```

#### Mock Wallet System
```typescript
// Comprehensive wallet mocking in flow-helpers.ts
const TEST_WALLETS = {
  alice: { address: '0x01cf0e2f2f715450', name: 'Alice Test Wallet' },
  bob: { address: '0x179b6b1cb6755e31', name: 'Bob Test Wallet' },
  charlie: { address: '0xf3fcd2c1a78f5eee', name: 'Charlie Test Wallet' },
}
```

#### API Mocking Strategy
- **Dapper Core API**: All NFT operations (mint, transfer, marketplace)
- **IPFS/NFT.Storage**: File uploads and metadata storage
- **Flow Access API**: Blockchain queries and event subscriptions
- **Real-time Events**: Custom event system for UI updates

#### Test Utilities
- **FlowTestHelpers**: Centralized helper functions for Flow operations
- **Test Data**: Consistent mock data and API responses
- **Error Simulation**: Comprehensive error scenario testing
- **Real-time Event Mocking**: Custom event system for testing

### ✅ Test Execution
