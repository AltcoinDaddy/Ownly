## Running the Tests

### Basic Integration Tests (No Emulator Required)
```bash
npm run test -- test/flow-emulator/basic-integration.test.ts --run
```

### CLI and Configuration Tests
```bash
npm run test -- test/flow-emulator/cli.test.ts --run
npm run test -- test/flow-emulator/config.test.ts --run
```

### Full Integration Tests (Requires Flow Emulator)
```bash
# Start Flow emulator first
flow emulator start

# Run full integration tests
npm run test -- test/flow-emulator/blockchain-integration.test.ts --run
npm run test -- test/flow-emulator/marketplace-integration.test.ts --run
npm run test -- test/flow-emulator/event-monitoring.test.ts --run
npm run test -- test/flow-emulator/wallet-integration.test.ts --run
```

### All Flow Tests
```bash
npm run test -- test/flow-emulator/ --run
```

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Flow CLI installed (`flow version` should work)
2. Node.js and npm/pnpm
3. Flow emulator (for full integration tests)

### Configuration
- Tests use testnet configuration by default
- Emulator tests configure FCL for local emulator
- Mock data and accounts are provided for testing

## Performance Considerations

- Event queue can handle 50+ events efficiently
- Transaction processing under 5 seconds for test scenarios
- Event ordering maintained under load
- Graceful error handling and recovery

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Network Testing**: Add tests against Flow testnet/mainnet
2. **Load Testing**: Stress test with high transaction volumes
3. **Cross-Contract Testing**: Test interactions between multiple contracts
4. **Gas Optimization**: Test transaction gas usage and optimization
5. **Security Testing**: Add security-focused test scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Flow CLI not found**: Install Flow CLI from https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli
2. **Emulator connection failed**: Ensure Flow emulator is running on default port
3. **Contract deployment errors**: Check flow.json configuration
4. **Event subscription timeouts**: Normal in test environment, tests handle gracefully

### Debug Tips
- Use `console.log` statements to trace test execution
- Check Flow emulator logs for transaction details
- Verify contract addresses in flow.json match test expectations
- Ensure proper test cleanup to avoid state conflicts
