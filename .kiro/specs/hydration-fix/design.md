# Design Document

## Overview

The hydration fix addresses React hydration mismatch errors by implementing proper SSR/client-side rendering patterns, eliminating browser-specific API usage during SSR, and ensuring consistent rendering between server and client. The solution focuses on identifying and resolving all sources of hydration mismatches while maintaining application functionality.

## Architecture

### Hydration-Safe Component Pattern
- **Client-Only Components**: Components that require browser APIs will be wrapped in client-only boundaries
- **SSR-Safe State Management**: State initialization will be consistent between server and client
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features that require browser APIs will be progressively enhanced after hydration

### Component Categories
1. **SSR-Safe Components**: Can render identically on server and client
2. **Client-Only Components**: Require browser APIs and should only render on client
3. **Hybrid Components**: Have both SSR-safe and client-only parts

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. ClientOnly Wrapper Component
```typescript
interface ClientOnlyProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
  fallback?: React.ReactNode
}
```
- Renders fallback during SSR
- Renders children only after hydration
- Prevents hydration mismatches for browser-dependent components

### 2. useIsomorphicLayoutEffect Hook
```typescript
const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect
```
- Provides consistent effect behavior between server and client
- Prevents hydration warnings from useLayoutEffect

### 3. useHydrated Hook
```typescript
interface UseHydratedReturn {
  isHydrated: boolean
}
```
- Tracks hydration state
- Allows components to render differently before/after hydration
- Ensures consistent initial render

### 4. SafeLocalStorage Utility
```typescript
interface SafeLocalStorageInterface {
  getItem: (key: string) => string | null
  setItem: (key: string, value: string) => void
  removeItem: (key: string) => void
}
```
- Provides SSR-safe localStorage access
- Returns null during SSR
- Prevents hydration mismatches from localStorage usage

## Data Models

### Hydration State
```typescript
interface HydrationState {
  isHydrated: boolean
  hasMounted: boolean
}
```

### Client-Only Feature State
```typescript
interface ClientFeatureState {
  isSupported: boolean
  isEnabled: boolean
  fallbackUsed: boolean
}
```

## Error Handling

### Hydration Error Detection
- Implement error boundaries specifically for hydration errors
- Log detailed information about hydration mismatches
- Provide fallback rendering for failed hydrations

### Browser API Fallbacks
- Graceful degradation when browser APIs are unavailable
- Consistent fallback behavior between server and client
- User feedback for unsupported features

## Testing Strategy

### Hydration Testing
- Unit tests for SSR/client rendering consistency
- Integration tests for hydration-sensitive components
- Visual regression tests for layout consistency

### Browser API Mocking
- Mock browser APIs in SSR environment
- Test fallback behavior
- Verify progressive enhancement

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create ClientOnly wrapper component
2. Implement useHydrated hook
3. Create SafeLocalStorage utility
4. Add useIsomorphicLayoutEffect hook

### Phase 2: Component Fixes
1. Fix WalletProvider hydration issues
2. Update components using navigator APIs
3. Fix components using localStorage/sessionStorage
4. Address Math.random() and Date.now() usage

### Phase 3: Layout and Styling
1. Fix dynamic className generation
2. Address CSS-in-JS hydration issues
3. Ensure consistent font loading
4. Fix responsive design hydration

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing
1. Add hydration error monitoring
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation updates

## Specific Issues Identified

### 1. WalletProvider localStorage Usage
- **Issue**: localStorage access during SSR causes hydration mismatch
- **Solution**: Use SafeLocalStorage utility and defer localStorage operations until after hydration

### 2. Navigator API Usage
- **Issue**: navigator.clipboard and navigator.share used without client-side checks
- **Solution**: Wrap in ClientOnly components or add proper client-side guards

### 3. Dynamic Content Generation
- **Issue**: Math.random() and Date.now() create different values on server vs client
- **Solution**: Use consistent seed values or defer dynamic content until after hydration

### 4. Event Listeners
- **Issue**: Window event listeners added during SSR
- **Solution**: Use useEffect to add listeners only on client side

### 5. Browser Extension Interference
- **Issue**: Browser extensions modify DOM before React hydration
- **Solution**: Implement robust error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
