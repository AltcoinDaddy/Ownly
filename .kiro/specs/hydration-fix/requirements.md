# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing React hydration mismatch errors that occur when the server-rendered HTML doesn't match the client-side React rendering. This creates a poor user experience with console errors and potential visual inconsistencies. We need to identify and fix the root causes of these hydration mismatches to ensure consistent rendering between server and client.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate hydration mismatch errors, so that the application renders consistently between server and client without console errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no hydration mismatch errors in the browser console
2. WHEN components render on the server THEN they SHALL produce identical HTML to client-side rendering
3. WHEN the application hydrates THEN all interactive elements SHALL function correctly without re-rendering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify components causing hydration issues, so that I can target specific fixes rather than debugging the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hydration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear identification of the problematic components
2. WHEN debugging hydration issues THEN there SHALL be tooling to compare server vs client rendered output
3. WHEN components use dynamic data THEN they SHALL handle server/client differences appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent future hydration issues, so that new code doesn't introduce similar problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components use browser-only APIs THEN they SHALL be properly guarded with client-side checks
2. WHEN components use dynamic data like dates or random values THEN they SHALL use consistent values between server and client
3. WHEN components conditionally render based on environment THEN they SHALL use proper SSR-safe patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without visual glitches, so that I have a smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN there SHALL be no visible content shifts or flashing
2. WHEN interactive elements appear THEN they SHALL be immediately functional without delay
3. WHEN the application renders THEN all styling SHALL be consistent between initial load and hydration
