# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing hydration mismatch errors where the server-rendered HTML doesn't match the client-side rendered content. This causes React to throw hydration errors and can lead to inconsistent UI behavior, performance issues, and poor user experience. The hydration fix feature will identify and resolve all sources of hydration mismatches to ensure seamless server-side rendering and client-side hydration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to hydrate without errors, so that users experience consistent rendering and optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN React SHALL NOT throw hydration mismatch errors
2. WHEN server-side rendering occurs THEN the HTML output SHALL match the client-side rendered output exactly
3. WHEN components use dynamic data THEN they SHALL handle SSR/client differences properly
4. WHEN browser-specific APIs are used THEN they SHALL be properly guarded for server environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load consistently, so that I don't see layout shifts or rendering inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN there SHALL be no visible layout shifts due to hydration mismatches
2. WHEN dynamic content renders THEN it SHALL appear consistently between server and client
3. WHEN the application initializes THEN all components SHALL render in their expected state
4. WHEN browser extensions modify the DOM THEN the application SHALL handle these gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify hydration issues early, so that I can prevent them from reaching production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hydration mismatches occur in development THEN they SHALL be clearly logged with specific component information
2. WHEN components have potential hydration issues THEN they SHALL be identified through static analysis
3. WHEN SSR/client differences exist THEN they SHALL be documented and properly handled
4. WHEN new components are added THEN they SHALL be validated for hydration compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper patterns for handling SSR/client differences, so that I can build hydration-safe components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components need client-only behavior THEN they SHALL use proper client-side rendering patterns
2. WHEN components use browser APIs THEN they SHALL be properly wrapped with client-side checks
3. WHEN components have dynamic content THEN they SHALL use consistent data sources for SSR and client
4. WHEN components render conditionally THEN the conditions SHALL be consistent between server and client
